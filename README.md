<p>Hi, my name is @ViscountV!<p/>
<p>In general, I'm interested in learning. I'm a naturally curious person, so it kind of <em>fuels</em> that, you know?</p>
<p>Over the past year, I've been getting into knitting; I'm very interested in crafts that allow me to work with my hands. When I'm not knitting, though, I'm usually either sleeping, working my part-time food service job, on Discord, or reading a book. Usually, not in that order. I also like listening to music while working. It helps me keep focus. My taste in music is all over the place, from 2000s hip-hop to K-R&B to jazz and neo-soul.</p>
<p>I'm a pretty shy person, but I love working with other people and seeing what we can create together. I can't wait to meet and code with y'all!</p>
